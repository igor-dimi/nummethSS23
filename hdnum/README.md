Heidelberg Educational Numerics Library (HDNUM)
===============================================

A simple to use and yet efficient C++ library for teaching numerical methods.

Installation
------------

There is no installation. Just include the header file `hdnum.hh` and
that is it.

Using the Makefiles
-----------------

Edit the file make.def in the top level directory to define your compiler command,
compilation flags, linker flags, and flags related to the GNU multiprecision library.
Compiler should be C++11 at least.
Then e.g. in examples/num 0 type "make" to just make all programs that do not need GMP support.
Write "make gmp" to build all programs needing GMP support and write "make all" to make them all.
"make clean" removes all executables.

Building the documentation
--------------------------

In the `hdnum` top-level directory just run `doxygen`. This will build
the Doxygen documentation into the directory `doc/html` or `doc/latex`,
respectively.
