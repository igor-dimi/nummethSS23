# Filesystem

Each use has a **home directory**, usually under `/home/<username>`.
Users don't have write priviliges outside of their home directory. 
The administrator is called **root** in unix and can write everywhere.
Each program has a **working directory**. File access is always relative to this working directory. Working directory can be switched. 

Linux provides usual GUI for interacting with the system but the **shell** still has advantages:

* automating repetitive tasks
* many taks can be done faster than with GUI
* many Unix programs don't have a GUI.
