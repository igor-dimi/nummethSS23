    "An object of a certain type can take different values during its existense. This transformation of values is called **change of state** of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can change the sate of an object residing in memory. This is called an **action**. The **instructions** to peform actions in a given programming language are called **statements**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The change of variables state caused by a statement is said to be the **effect** of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expressions**  do not transform the state of the variables, but denote **values**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are formed according to the rules of some formal notation (like the language of arithemtic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some expressions: `1 - (3 / 6)`, `1 + x * (y % 10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "* expressions **denote values**,\n",
    "* statements **have effects**\n",

    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic statement is the **assignment**. It has the **effect** of updating the value of the variable to the value denoted by the **expression** on the right-hand side of the assignment operator. In C++:\n"

    "\n",
    "In some programming languages like Pascal the world of statements and the world of expressions are completely distinct. A given syntactical entity is either a statement or an expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in C/C++ a syntactical entity can be both a statement (have an effect) and an expression (denote a value). \n",
    "The action that such an expression performs is called the **side effect** of the expression.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: `j--` is both a statement and an expression. Its effect is to assign to the variable `j` the value of the expression `j - 1`. I.e. it is equivalent to `j = j - 1`. As an expression it denotes the value `j` before assignment."
