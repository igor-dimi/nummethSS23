    "## Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "An object [^1] of a certain type can take different values during its existense. This transformation of values is called **change of state** of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can change the sate of an object residing in memory. This is called an **action**. The **instructions** to peform actions in a given programming language are called **statements**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The change of a variable's state as specified by a statement is said to be the **effect** of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expressions** on the other hand,  do **not** transform the state of the variables, but merely denote **values**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are formed according to the rules of some formal notation (like the language of arithemtic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some expressions: `1 - (3 / 6)`, `1 + x * (y % 10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "```{attention}\n",
    "* expressions **denote values**,\n",
    "* statements **have effects**\n",

    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Understanding this dichotomy between statements and expessions is fundamental. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic statement is the **assignment**. Its has the basic form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "x = E;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Its **effect** is to update the value of the variable `x` on the left hand side of `=` to the **value** denoted by the **expression** `E` on the right-hand side of the assignment operator. In C++:\n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: Here we use the word \"object\" not in the object-oriented sense, but in it most general sense; simply standing for any concrete sequence of bits (corresponding to some variable of a certain type) residing in memory.\n",
