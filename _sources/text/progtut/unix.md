# Unix 

Unix was initially released in 1969. Many Unix-based operating systems emerged:

* **Free-**, **Net-**, and **OpenBSD** based on UC Berkeley's version of Unix.
* **macOS**, partially based on FreeBSD and NetBSD
* **iOS**, based on macOS
* **illumos/OpenIndiana**, based on Solaris and System V
* **Linux (1991)**, stricly speaking not a Unix, but compatible at most
* **Android**, a strongly modified Linux developed by Google.
* many various **embedded systems**

Some facts:

* 95% of 500 fastest computers run Unix
* Most web servers run Unix
* Most scientific communities use Unix/Linux.

Most software installed under Linux is open source, i.e. it's source code is
free to insepct and learn from.
